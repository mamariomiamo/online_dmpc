% Beta - converts control points into polynomial coefficients
Beta = mat_bernstein2power(d, l, ndim);

% Gamma - sample the polynomial at different time steps
Gamma = mat_sample_poly(T_segment, 0:h:((k_hor-1)*h), d, l);

% Alpha - sum of squared derivatives of the position
cr = zeros(1, d+1); % weights on degree of derivative deg = [0 1 ... d]
cr(3) = cost_acc;
Alpha = mat_sum_sqrd_derivatives(d, T_segment, cr, l, ndim);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CONSTRUCT TERMS OF THE COST FUNCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The Hessian for the minimum snap cost function is
H_snap = Beta'*Alpha*Beta;

% For the goal tracking error cost function, define a weight matrix S
% Case 1: no collisions in the horizon - go fast
S_free = s_free*[zeros(3*(k_hor-spd_f), 3*k_hor);
                 zeros(3*spd_f, 3*(k_hor-spd_f)) eye(3*spd_f)];

               zeros(3*spd_o, 3*(k_hor-spd_o)) eye(3*spd_o)];

% Case 3: colliding scenario, change setpoint and repel rapidly

% The complete Hessian is simply the sum of the two
H_f = H_free + H_snap;
H_o = H_obs + H_snap;
H_r = H_repel + H_snap;

% Predefine this matrix to construct f_pf_repel when needed
